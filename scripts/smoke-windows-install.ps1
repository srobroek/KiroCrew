# Install the Windows desktop artifact for real on a clean runner, boot the
# gateway it installed, then uninstall it and assert the removal.
#
# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT INLINE YAML: the same reason
# scripts/smoke-linux-packages.sh is a script. Two callers will want the
# identical assertions (build-windows.yml today, a packaging-path PR lane later),
# and inlining is how those drift -- at which point the lane that matters is the
# one missing a check.
#
# Everything here is invisible to a unit test, because it lives in the NSIS
# metadata and the registry rather than in code we run:
#
#   * the uninstall registration, whose InstallLocation is what an in-place
#     update and the auto-updater both resolve against.
#   * the install-root OWNERSHIP boundary. The generated uninstaller removes
#     $INSTDIR recursively, so a fresh install must own a directory that did not
#     exist beforehand. installer.nsh's KiroEnsureAppInstallDir is what enforces
#     that, and nothing but a real install exercises it.
#   * the Start Menu shortcut, and specifically whether its target names the
#     bytes THIS install wrote. installer.nsh carries a whole heal path for a
#     shortcut left naming a stale sibling root, and a .lnk is a pointer no
#     build-time check can follow.
#   * the bundled CLI's reachability as its own NEW process, run from the
#     installed prefix rather than found on PATH.
#   * that the installed tree can actually BOOT. The packaged interpreter ships
#     checked-hash bytecode for the gateway import closure, so a prune that drops
#     a module produces an artifact that installs green and refuses to start.
#
# EVERY IDENTITY IS DERIVED FROM THE ARTIFACT AND THE REGISTRY, never written
# here. The nightly channel deliberately ships different ones so it can sit
# beside stable: build-desktop.sh overrides productName to "KiroCrew Nightly",
# extraMetadata.name and nsis.guid for a "-nightly." version, which changes the
# install directory, the DisplayName, the app executable's filename, the shortcut
# name and the uninstall registry key together. Hardcoding stable's spelling
# would fail this gate on every nightly build. Reading the repo's package.json
# would be just as wrong: those overrides are electron-builder CLI flags, so the
# file on disk still says "Kiro Crew" while the artifact says otherwise. The
# identity therefore comes from the registration this install CREATES, found by
# diffing the uninstall keys around it.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT: a PATH edit. The Windows installer
# makes none. `nsis` in website/electron/package.json declares no PATH handling
# and website/electron/build/installer.nsh touches only shortcuts and the
# updater cache, so there is no `kirocrew` on PATH after a desktop install and
# never has been. Asserting one would bake a false claim into a gate. The bundled
# CLI is reached at its packaged path instead, which is what
# docs/guides/windows-install.md describes and what the managed-server
# invocation actually resolves.
#
# Usage: smoke-windows-install.ps1 -DistDir <dir containing the built Setup .exe>
