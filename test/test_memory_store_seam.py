"""Pins for the memory-store seam gate, ``scripts/check_memory_store_seam.py``.

A named memory store is a separate SQLite silo. A memory-context call site that
does not name one reads whatever the resolver defaults to — the operator's own
``default`` store — for a crew that configured otherwise, and nothing goes red:
the prompt is well-formed and the content is plausible. The gate exists to make
that unrepresentable on added lines, so a gate that has silently stopped
matching is worse than no gate at all. These tests are what makes that visible.

Two of them are the anti-fooling probes, and they matter more than the rest:
:func:`test_similar_names_in_the_persistence_path_are_not_reported` pins that
matching is AST-based rather than textual (a substring implementation would hit
every ``_build_message_entry`` in the chat-persistence path), and
:func:`test_prose_naming_the_call_is_not_reported` pins the same property from
the other direction.

# The whole-tree backlog as it stands, per rule. Diff mode is what enforces
# today, so this is the count the gate REPORTS without failing; it shrinks as
# each call site is converted and the shrink is a deliberate edit here. A count
# that GREW means a new undeclared call site landed on a line the diff gate did
# not see.
#
# A rule with nothing left to report is ABSENT rather than zero: the comparison
# below is against a ``Counter``, which never mints a zero entry, so a rule listed
# at 0 could only ever fail. ``resolver-memory-root-required`` is in that state —
# both of its sites now name the global store, and
# :func:`test_no_resolver_site_reaches_its_root_by_omission` is what keeps them
# naming it rather than silently drifting back to omission.
# The two that remain all share one property, and it is the reason they are
# still here rather than a shortfall of effort: NOTHING IN THEIR SCOPE NAMES A
# CREW. Reading the global store is the correct answer for each, and the honest
# spelling of that is to leave the omission visible in this count rather than to
# paper it over with a keyword that changes nothing. The only value any of them
# holds is an `agent`, which is a kiro-cli template id — a namespace DISJOINT
# from `cfg.agents` — so deriving a store from one would answer `default` for
# exactly the crew that configured otherwise (the gate's own
# `store-not-derived-from-agent` rule refuses it):
#
#   slack/gateway.py  the heartbeat — one process-wide `HEARTBEAT_KEY` on the fixed
#                     `kirocrew-heartbeat` template
#   eval/runner.py    the offline eval harness — a synthetic `eval_<name>_<ns>` key
