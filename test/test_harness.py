"""Tests for ``kiro_crew.testing.harness`` — gateway-spawning context manager.

Most tests exercise the harness's internal helpers in isolation with a
stand-in for ``subprocess.Popen``. Spawning a real gateway takes 5–15s
and pulls in the full MCP probe / config init / dashboard bind path, so
the end-to-end test is gated behind ``KIROCREW_HARNESS_INTEGRATION``.

This file runs on Windows too. A wholesale collect-ignore of it is what
hid the READY-wait and orchestration tests -- the majority of it, and all of the
platform-neutral part -- from the only shards that could have caught the
selectors-on-a-pipe break. What is genuinely POSIX-only is the ``terminate_pgid``
family plus the SIGKILL return-code assertions, and those carry
``_POSIX_ONLY`` per test. Nothing else is skipped: see
``docs/system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md`` on why a whole-file skip is
the expensive kind of green.
