"""Scenario-level E2E over the existing ``kirocrew pod`` tooling.

One session-scoped pod, five scenarios that each drive it through a user-visible
flow: save a setting across a gateway restart, fire a cron, run an agent turn,
render the host service definition against the pod home, and install the built
wheel into a scratch venv.

Plain pytest, deliberately: the repo's isolation, timeout and sharding story is
pytest-shaped (``setup.cfg`` addopts, ``pytest-timeout``, xdist ``loadgroup``),
and a second framework would need a second isolation story to match. See
``docs/system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md``.

Gating mirrors ``docs/ci/e2e-gate.md``:

* ``KIROCREW_E2E_SCENARIOS`` unset -> every scenario skips. The suite boots a
  real service-managed pod, which is minutes and a service manager away from a
  bare ``pytest`` run.
* ``KIROCREW_E2E_SCENARIOS_REQUIRE=1`` -> every precondition skip becomes a
  FAILURE. A skip counts as a pass, so without this the nightly job would go
  green having run zero scenarios. Same reason ``KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE`` exists.

Platform: the fixture asks the pod's OWN gate (``runtime.require_backend``)
whether this host can run pods at all, so Linux picks systemd and macOS picks
launchd with no test-side platform test. Scenario bodies carry no platform
branching whatsoever, which is what makes Windows a pure matrix add -- and the
Task Scheduler backend now exists, so ``require_backend`` finds one here too. What
is still missing is one validated run, not a backend;
``test/test_pod_scenario_matrix.py`` holds that reason as an assertion, so it
cannot go stale the way this paragraph would.
