"""Gateway boot smoke on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows.

This is the cross-OS end-to-end floor: a real ``kirocrew gateway`` subprocess, a
real HTTP round trip, a real ACP session and a real prompt turn, on every
platform Kiro Crew ships to. Everything is offline and credential-less -- the
agent binary is the packaged fake ACP backend, wired through
``KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN`` exactly as ``test/test_e2e_smoke.py`` does -- so no model,
no token and no network is involved.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Before it, nothing on ``windows-latest`` or ``macos-15``
started a gateway at all: ``test_e2e_smoke.py`` is gated on ``KIROCREW_E2E``,
which only the Linux ``e2e`` job sets. That is one of the two holes
a Windows startup break shipped through. The change added
a settings-file probe to ``wrap_argv``'s Windows delegation branch, so on a fresh
Windows host -- where that file does not exist -- the Kiro ACP spawn stopped
delegating, hit the no-backend fail-closed path, and the gateway never became
usable. Its unit coverage lived in ``test_sandbox_argv.py``, which Windows does
not collect, and the PR itself changed that test's mock to hardcode the one
answer a fresh host cannot give. Only a real boot on the real platform closes
that. ``test_seeded_sandbox_mode_boots_and_runs_a_turn`` is the direct pin.

SHAPE. Every test boots its OWN gateway on its own scratch ``KIROCREW_HOME``
rather than sharing a module-scoped one. That costs a boot per test and buys
freedom from order dependence (flake class 4), which matters more here than
elsewhere because these tests differ in the CONFIG the gateway booted with.

Readiness is tuned per OS through ``KIROCREW_HARNESS_READY_TIMEOUT`` in the job
env, not in this file, so a slow runner is retunable without a code change.

Run it with ``-n0``: it spawns real processes, and under xdist a block would take
the worker down with it, which on Windows aborts the whole run (see
``docs/system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md``, flake class 6).

Gating, and why there are two markers:

* ``KIROCREW_E2E`` lifts the module skip. A bare ``pytest`` run does not pay
  seven gateway boots.
* ``KIROCREW_E2E_MATRIX_REQUIRE`` turns an unmet PRECONDITION from a graceful
  ``pytest.skip`` into a ``pytest.fail``. A skip counts as a pass, so without it
  a required job could go green having booted zero gateways. Same mechanism as
  ``KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE`` in ``test_playwright_e2e.py``; see
  ``docs/ci/e2e-gate.md``.
