"""The pod-scenario matrix must track which platforms actually have a pod backend.

That tier's platform coverage is decided by exactly ONE fact -- whether
``runtime.require_backend()`` finds a service manager on the host -- because no
scenario body and no job carries a platform branch. The matrix is therefore a pure
consequence of which backends exist, which is also why a comment saying a platform
is "deferred until a backend lands" cannot be trusted: the day one lands, the
comment is false and nothing notices.

So the deferral is expressed HERE, as an assertion, instead of in prose. Every
platform whose backend exists must either be in the matrix or be named in
:data:`PENDING_VALIDATION` with the reason it is not, and that reason is what a
reviewer reads instead of trusting a comment to still be true.

Deliberately a plain unit test rather than part of the E2E tier: it reads YAML and
imports nothing that needs a host with pods, so it runs on every shard, including
the ones that cannot run a scenario at all.
