"""Three ways the Windows pod boot answered wrongly about its own gateway.

Each is a fact the canary proved on windows-latest and no fake could: the pid
that binds the port is not the pid the supervisor records, a POSIX shell script
reached ``bash`` and got WSL, and the agent-backend pin never left the plane.
All three fixes are platform-neutral Python, so these run everywhere with the
platform flag pinned.
