"""The Windows fail-closed sandbox opt-in contract, on a real win32 host.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT test_sandbox_argv.py

A Windows startup break added one conjunct
to ``wrap_argv``'s Windows delegation predicate::

    ) or (sys.platform == "win32" and is_kiro_cli is True and kiro_internal_sandbox_enabled())

``kiro_internal_sandbox_enabled()`` reads ``~/.kiro/settings/amazon-internal.json``
and returns False when that file is absent. A fresh Windows install does not have
it. So delegation stopped, control fell through to backend detection, Windows has
no Kiro Crew OS sandbox backend, and the no-backend policy fail-closed: the ACP
backend never started and the gateway never became usable.

``test/test_sandbox_argv.py`` already pinned that exact branch and did not catch
it, for two compounding reasons. It is line 2 of ``test/windows-collect-ignore.txt``,
so it is not collected on ``windows-latest`` at all. And where it does run, in the
Linux shards, it monkeypatches ``kiro_crew.sandbox.sys.platform`` to ``"win32"``
and patches ``kiro_internal_sandbox_enabled`` to ``return_value=True`` -- which
hardcodes the one answer a fresh Windows host cannot give. Real filesystem state
was never involved on any OS.

This file is therefore built on the opposite principle, and every rule below is
load-bearing rather than stylistic:

* It runs ONLY on win32 and is skipped elsewhere with a reason. It is deliberately
  absent from ``windows-collect-ignore.txt`` so the Windows shards collect it, and
  a dedicated ``windows-latest`` canary job in ``ci.yml`` runs it by node id and
  greps the pass count, because ``pytest -q`` does not name passing tests and a
  skip exits 0 -- a canary that quietly stopped running would leave the job green
  while the contract it proves went unverified.
* It patches NEITHER ``sys.platform`` NOR the settings probe. The platform is real
  and the probe reads the real absent file. ``_settings_probe_answers_false``
  asserts that precondition explicitly and SKIPS a host that happens to carry the
  file, so a developer machine cannot produce a misleading result either way.
* The policy is flipped by WRITING ``config.json`` to disk, not by patching
  ``_allow_unsandboxed_exec``. The config cache is fingerprint-keyed on a stat, so
  the write is what invalidates it -- the same path an operator takes. Note which
  write means what on THIS platform: an undeclared
  ``agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`` already resolves to ``True`` on win32
  (``unsandboxed_exec_platform_default``), so the operator gesture that refuses is
  a declared ``false``, and a config that merely omits the key is a host that runs.

Two halves, matching the two things a fresh Windows host must do:

``TestFreshWindowsHostPrecondition`` / ``TestWrapArgvContract`` -- in-process
``wrap_argv`` against real filesystem state. This is where the fail-closed pair
lives, because driving an unclassified spawn all the way through a booted gateway
would prove the same predicate through several hundred lines of unrelated
machinery and fail for many more reasons than the one under test.

``TestFreshWindowsGatewayDelegates`` -- a real gateway process, one session and
one prompt turn against the packaged fake ACP backend. ``/api/health`` alone is
NOT sufficient: it answers while the ACP spawn is being refused, which is exactly
how that break stayed invisible. The prompt turn is the load-bearing assertion.

It does NOT use ``kiro_crew.testing.harness.spawn_feature_gateway``, which cannot
run on Windows today: ``_wait_for_ready_line`` registers a PIPE with
``selectors.DefaultSelector()`` (the Windows selector accepts sockets only) and
teardown goes through ``terminate_pgid``, which calls ``os.killpg`` / ``os.getpgid``
(absent on Windows). The minimal reader thread below is a deliberate stand-in and
should fold into the harness once it is cross-platform. It still imports
``parse_ready_line`` from the harness rather than re-parsing the READY line, so
the wire contract has exactly one owner.
