"""Boot a REAL pod on Windows, through the real Task Scheduler, and reclaim it.

Everything in ``test_pod_windows.py`` fakes ``schtasks`` so the backend has
coverage on the Linux matrix. This file is the other half: it creates an actual
scheduled task, boots the worktree's actual gateway under it, waits for
``/api/health``, and then proves ``pod down`` leaves neither a task nor a
process. Nothing here can be established by a fake, which is why it is a
separate file with its own preconditions.

**It never skips.** A skip is how a boot canary rots: the job stays green while
the thing it was written to prove stops running. Every precondition this test
needs -- ``schtasks`` usable by the runner user, a built venv in the checkout --
is asserted with ``pytest.fail`` naming the cause, so the CI step's
``grep "1 passed"`` cannot pass on a test that did not really run.

**Not collected by the sharded Windows job.** It is listed in
``windows-collect-ignore.txt`` because it needs a built ``.venv`` that the
shards' ``uv pip install --system`` does not create, and because a five-minute
boot does not belong in a duration-balanced shard. The dedicated canary step in
``ci.yml`` names the file explicitly on the pytest command line, which bypasses
``collect_ignore`` by design (see that file's header).

Health goes over **TCP** here, unlike the Linux path's private AF_UNIX socket:
CPython on Windows has no ``AF_UNIX``. So the port is read back from ``pod up
--json`` rather than re-derived, because allocation can move a pod off its
first-preference slot and the recorded claim is the only authority.

The pod plane is rooted at a SHORT absolute path (``C:\\kcpb<hex>``) rather than
under pytest's ``tmp_path``. A deep temporary directory is how the sibling
POSIX work hit an AF_UNIX path-length ceiling; here the risk is Windows'
``MAX_PATH`` reaching the pod's own nested run/session directories, and the
mitigation is the same one: keep the root short.
