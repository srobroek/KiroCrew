"""Tests for ``GET /api/sessions/clearable/count`` and its shared selector.

Ask 4 of #8872 needs the confirmation for a bulk delete to state how many
sessions it will remove. ``DELETE /api/sessions`` offered no way to learn that
before committing, so this endpoint answers it and nothing else.

Two properties carry the feature and each has tests here:

- the endpoint is READ-ONLY. Proven by naming the survivors — the files are
  still on disk afterwards, byte-identical, with unchanged mtimes. An
  "assert nothing was deleted" would pass just as happily against an empty
  directory, which is why it is not the assertion used.
- the count and the delete resolve the SAME set, because they call one
  selector that takes no cutoff. A count the delete does not honour is worse
  than no count: a filtered count would report a subset of what the unfiltered
  delete permanently unlinks.
