/**
 * The chat-core transport's wire for an app-sdk embed.
 *
 * `sendTurn` classifies a send through the shared `readSendReceipt` reader,
 * which wants the fetch seam's shape: a response that RESOLVES on every HTTP
 * status and rejects only when the request never went out. The scoped
 * `AppApi` an app is handed does not look like that -- its JSON helper throws
 * on non-2xx and returns the parsed body on 2xx -- and it is the ONLY client
 * an embed may use, because it is what enforces the host app's declared
 * `allowedApiPaths` (an embed's send must stay a permission the app grants).
 *
 * This adapter re-expresses the scoped helper's outcomes in the seam's shape,
 * so an embed's receipt is read by the same classifier as every other
 * surface's:
 *
 * - 2xx with a JSON body      -> resolved `{ ok: true }` whose `json()` yields
 *                                the body (`dispatched` / `queued` / a
 *                                readable refusal, by the shared rule).
 * - 2xx, body unreadable      -> resolved `{ ok: true }` whose `json()`
 *   (stream cut or non-JSON)     rejects, i.e. `unknown`. The helper tags a
 *                                post-2xx failure `AcceptedBodyUnreadable`, so
 *                                it is never mistaken for a request that never
 *                                left (also a `TypeError`); the old embed send
 *                                swallowed the non-JSON case as success.
 * - non-2xx                   -> resolved `{ ok: false }` carrying the body
 *                                text, i.e. a `refused` receipt that keeps the
 *                                server's own reason.
 * - permission denied         -> resolved `{ ok: false }` whose body carries a
 *                                human sentence ("This app isn't allowed to
 *                                send chat messages"), i.e. `refused` with a
 *                                reason. Nothing left the document, so the
 *                                payload is safe to hand back -- but "check
 *                                your connection" would be advice that can
 *                                never succeed, so this is not a transport
 *                                error. The developer detail (app name, path,
 *                                declared grants) goes to the console, where
 *                                the person who can act on it is.
 * - fetch itself rejected     -> rejected with `AbortError`, i.e.
 *                                `response-late`. A raw network rejection
 *                                cannot tell "never left" (offline, DNS) from
 *                                "the server took the POST and the connection
 *                                reset before headers" -- and this is a single
 *                                POST with no earlier call on the same link to
 *                                weigh the odds. Indeterminate, so it must NOT
 *                                be the retry-safe `transport-error`: the embed
 *                                hands the text back under the unconfirmed
 *                                notice and the poll's `sendId` echo retires it
 *                                if the turn did run, instead of inviting a
 *                                duplicate turn.
 * - `signal` fired            -> rejected with `AbortError`, i.e.
 *                                `response-late`. The scoped helper takes no
 *                                signal, so the underlying fetch is not
 *                                cancelled -- the deadline is honoured at the
 *                                receipt, which is the contract that matters.
 *
 * `?ws=1` selects the JSON receipt instead of the SSE stream the bare
 * endpoint answers with. The scoped path check reads only the pathname and
 * passes the query through, so this needs no new permission from the app.
