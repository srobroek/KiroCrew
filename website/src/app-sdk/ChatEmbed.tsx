/**
 * ChatEmbed — embeddable chat widget using KiroCrew's native rendering.
 *
 * Uses ChatMessageList (shared with ChatPage) for message rendering.
 * Transcript and send state live in useAppApi() + React Query; the composer
 * subtree (ChatInput) reads slot state from Redux, so a host mounts this under
 * the dashboard store as every in-tree app already does.
 *
 * State management: polling via useQuery refetchInterval.
 * Poll faster during streaming (1s), slower when idle (5s).
 *
 * Sending goes through the chat-core transport (`sendTurn`) over the app-sdk
 * wire, so the receipt contract is the shared one and the host app's
 * `allowedApiPaths` grant for `/api/chat` still gates the POST.
 *
 * The composer is the REAL native ChatInput (the same one ChatPage, ChatPane
 * and SideChat render), mounted inside a SlotProvider for the embedded slot
 * with its FAIL-CLOSED `embedded` flag: every capability that defaults on
 * for a first-class composer (typed command menus, prompt optimizer,
 * slot-approval chrome) is forced off, and the opt-in chrome (upload, voice,
 * agent/model/project) is simply not passed. A capability added to ChatInput
 * later must consult the flag before it defaults on, so nothing lights up
 * inside an app embed by convention.
 *
 * Why the flag exists, and the question to ask before granting any capability
 * prop here, is stated ONCE on `ChatInputProps.embedded` -- read it there.
 * `ChatEmbed.noDashboardClient.test.tsx` pins the invariant it protects.

   *  - The slot-detail payload this embed polls carries no `mode` field, so the
   *    embed structurally lacks the orchestrator-mode gate the dispatch path
   *    requires (ChatPane/ChatPage read the slot record's mode before
   *    dispatching; there is no equivalent source here).
   *  - Exposure is narrow: `api_chat_slot_detail` runs
   *    `_deny_cross_app_slot_access`, so an app-token embed 404s on any foreign
   *    or unscoped slot. That proves "not another surface's slot", not "never a
   *    plan-bearing slot" — an app could create and embed its own
   *    orchestrator-mode slot, which is exactly why the missing mode field
   *    above, not the ownership guard, carries the exclusion.
   *  - On hosts that DO dispatch, the `isPlanAction` allowlist keeps
   *    non-protocol plan-shaped labels on the composer path; this file never
   *    consults it because it never dispatches.
   *  SideChat makes the same exclusion, silently — it also destructures only
   *  `followUpOptions`, with no record there. If dashboard-token embeds ever
   *  need working plan chips, the parity option is wiring `usePlanActionMutation`
   *  plus a mode source into this file — a product decision, not an oversight.
