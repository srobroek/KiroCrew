/**
 * ChatEmbed's transcript-tail records, one per send, retired independently.
 *
 * A send that was refused or whose delivery could not be confirmed leaves a
 * row at the transcript's tail (an `error` or a `notice`) and, for a composer
 * submit, hands its text back into the composer. Several such records can be
 * live at once: the hand-back buffer (`embedSendRecovery`) keeps every receipt
 * that landed after its embed unmounted, and the next embed for the slot
 * drains them all. Each record therefore carries its OWN `sendId`, and proof
 * of delivery -- the polled user row that echoes that id -- retires that one
 * record only. Keeping a single "last outcome" here would let a later
 * recovery overwrite an earlier one's id, so the earlier send's delivered text
 * could never be taken back and would sit in the composer inviting a
 * duplicate turn.
 *
 * Taking the text back is chain-aware. Restores merge into the composer one
 * after another (`mergeRecoveredDraft`), so retiring the FIRST of two means
 * rebuilding the composer from that record's `before` with every later
 * restore replayed on top -- and only when the composer still holds exactly
 * what the chain produced and nothing was typed between the restores. Any
 * edit since leaves the text alone: withdrawing text the user has touched
 * would re-create the silent loss this surface exists to prevent.
