   *    a plan awaiting dispatch; `useComposerDraft` owning the chip (pick → edits the
   *    draft, amendable before send) is therefore the correct behaviour, not a
   *    fallback.
   *  - The dispatch path gates on the HOST slot's mode (ChatPage reads
   *    `effectiveMode === 'orchestrator'` off the slot record before dispatching).
   *    This panel does not read the host slot's mode today — its transcript is the
   *    side buffer, a private mini-conversation beside the parent slot — and wiring
   *    `usePlanActionMutation` in would first need that mode selector added, gating
   *    on the PARENT's mode for a conversation that is not the parent's.
   *  - An unconditional dispatch (no mode gate) would let any plan-shaped side
   *    answer cancel or advance the parent's real plan.
