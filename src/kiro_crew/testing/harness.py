"""Test harness for spawning isolated KiroCrew gateways.

Companion to the ``--test-mode`` / ``--json-ready`` / ``--port`` / ``--approval``
CLI flags on ``kirocrew gateway``. Provides a context manager that spins up
an isolated, headless gateway from the current workspace's source tree (not
the system-installed ``kirocrew``), reads the ``KIROCREW_READY:{...}`` line
off stdout, and tears down cleanly on exit.

Transport-agnostic: ``GatewayHandle`` exposes the URL plus a few metadata
fields. The caller chooses the driver (Playwright via DSO Frontend MCP is
the recommended one; plain HTTP for backend-only smoke tests is fine but
not the recommended path).

Usage:

    from kiro_crew.testing.harness import spawn_feature_gateway

    with spawn_feature_gateway() as handle:
        # drive Playwright / urllib / etc against handle.url
        ...
    # subprocess and tmp KIROCREW_HOME are gone by here

Reusable primitives:

    ``parse_ready_line`` and ``terminate_pgid`` are public, I/O-agnostic
    building blocks. Out-of-process supervisors that drive a *detached*
    gateway (tail its log for the READY line, terminate it later by pid
    without holding the ``Popen``) can reuse them instead of re-implementing
    the wire-contract parse and the SIGTERM→SIGKILL group kill.

Cross-platform: the harness runs on Linux, macOS and Windows. Two things had
to be platform-neutral for that, and both are load-bearing rather than
cosmetic:

    * The READY wait reads the child's stdout through a daemon reader thread
      feeding a ``queue.Queue`` (:class:`_StdoutPump`). ``selectors`` cannot
      poll a PIPE on Windows -- ``DefaultSelector`` there is select()-based and
      accepts sockets only -- so a selector-driven read is not merely slower on
      Windows, it raises. The queue's bounded ``get`` preserves what the
      selector poll bought: the deadline is enforced even while the child is
      alive and silent.
    * Teardown routes through ``platform_compat.kill_process_tree`` on Windows
      (``taskkill /T /F``) instead of ``terminate_pgid``; there is no
      ``setsid`` / ``killpg`` there. See
      ``docs/system-specs/common/platform-compat.md``.

def fake_acp_backend_launcher(directory: Path) -> Path:
    """The path to hand ``KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN`` so the gateway spawns the packaged
    fake ACP backend, on every platform.

    On POSIX that is ``fake_acp_backend.__file__`` itself: the module carries a
    shebang and is exec'd in place. Windows has no shebang, so ``CreateProcess``
    refuses a ``.py`` path outright; it DOES run a ``.cmd`` (handed to the
    command interpreter), and ``.cmd`` is in ``platform_compat``'s
    runnable-suffix set, so the candidate also survives ``is_executable_file``.
    ``build.yml`` stages its Windows backend payload as ``kirocrew.cmd`` for the
    same reason.

    Named ``kiro-backend.cmd`` ON PURPOSE, not ``kiro-cli.exe``: delegation to
    Kiro CLI's own sandbox must come from the reviewed ACP call site passing
    ``is_kiro_cli=True``, never from the basename, so a launcher whose name
    cannot satisfy ``_spawns_kiro_cli`` proves the classification is what grants
    it. ``directory`` must outlive the gateway that runs the shim.

    **A batch file is re-parsed by cmd.exe, so the interpreter path is a literal
    that has to be escaped.** ``%`` doubles (a batch file expands ``%%`` to one
    literal ``%``), and a double quote or a newline is REFUSED rather than
    escaped, because cmd.exe has no escape for a quote inside a quoted token and
    silently booting the wrong path is worse than failing here. That is the same
    rule ``kiro_crew.pod.windows._cmd_literal`` applies to the pod wrapper; the
    two cannot share a body because the pod one raises a pod-specific refusal that
    must fail ``pod up``, and this one is a harness error.

    **RESIDUAL, stated because it cannot be closed inside a batch file:** cmd.exe
    expands ``%VAR%`` in the text ``%*`` substitutes, so an ACP argument
    containing ``%`` reaches the backend expanded rather than verbatim, and ``^``
    is eaten as an escape. ``%*`` is the only way a batch file forwards its
    arguments, and the fake backend reads ``sys.argv``, so this cannot be dropped.
    The argv the ACP client builds for a launch carries no ``%``; a caller that
    needs one must not route through this shim.

    The file is written in the console's OEM code page, not ASCII: cmd.exe decodes
    a ``.cmd`` in that page, and ``ascii`` additionally raised
    ``UnicodeEncodeError`` outright on a non-ASCII interpreter path.

            passing it makes teardown independent of the leader still being

            pass ``proc.wait`` — handle-based detection sees the exit
            immediately even while the child is an unreaped zombie, which the
            default pid poll cannot distinguish from a live process. Without a
            hook, liveness is polled on the whole GROUP (``os.killpg(pgid,
            0)``) so a fast-exiting leader with lingering children still
            escalates to the group SIGKILL.

    Does NOT reap: a supervisor that owns the ``Popen`` should ``proc.wait()``
    afterwards; an out-of-process caller relies on init reaping the reparented
    child. No-op if the process is already gone. ``PermissionError`` (pid
    recycled to another user, or reduced privilege) aborts the teardown with a
    logged diagnostic rather than crashing or silently no-opping.

    Windows has no ``setsid`` / ``killpg``, so ``terminate_pgid``'s whole
    mechanism is unavailable; ``platform_compat.kill_process_tree`` is the
    repo's one helper for this (see platform-compat.md). It walks the real
    parent/child tree, which is what reaches the gateway's MCP servers and
    kiro-cli children -- ``proc.terminate()`` would signal only the parent and
    leave them holding the ephemeral port.

    There is no graceful step to attempt first: ``taskkill /F`` is a hard
    terminate, and Windows offers no SIGTERM equivalent deliverable to a child
    that shares no console. The child therefore gets no shutdown budget on this
    platform, which is acceptable for a throwaway test gateway and is why the
    grace constant is only used for the reap below.

    **Returns whether the TREE is gone, not whether the root was reaped.** Those
    are different answers, and the caller spends this one on whether it may delete
    the gateway's HOME. ``proc.wait()`` succeeding proves only that the process this
    harness spawned has been collected: a ``taskkill`` that failed on a protected
    or transiently-inaccessible descendant is logged and swallowed (correctly --
    teardown must not turn a passing test red), so deriving the verdict from the
    reap alone reported success while a grandchild was still running, and the
    caller then removed a tree under a live writer. The descendants are therefore
    SNAPSHOTTED BEFORE the kill -- a kill orphans survivors out of the parent map,

    children can outlive it and hold the ephemeral port or cache files open.

    POSIX delegates the SIGTERM→SIGKILL group kill to ``terminate_pgid`` (shared
    with out-of-process supervisors), passing ``proc.wait`` as the
    exit-detection hook — handle-based detection returns the instant the
    child exits (even before it's reaped), so a graceful SIGTERM teardown
    doesn't burn the full grace window the way a pid poll would. Then
    ``proc.wait()`` reaps so the child doesn't linger as a zombie.
    ``TERMINATE_GRACE_SECONDS`` is read at call time so tests can patch it.

    Windows takes ``_terminate_process_tree_windows`` instead: process groups
    are a POSIX concept and the group primitives do not exist there.

    the gateway's HOME -- so short-circuiting on ``proc.poll()`` reported success
    with a live writer still in that directory. Both sweeps below stay correct for
    a dead root: a POSIX process group outlives its leader, which is exactly why
