"""Live config: one poll, one reload, one dispatch.

The gateway holds many long-lived objects that copy a config value at
construction (the session manager's idle timeout, the subagent manager's
concurrency cap, a channel transport's allow-list). A write to ``config.json``
reaches those copies only if something pushes the new value at them, and only
the writer that happens to know about a copy can push -- which left every
``kirocrew config set`` and every hand edit silently inert for those fields.

This module is the single mechanism that closes the gap:

* **One poll.** :class:`ConfigWatch` runs a single background task that
  compares the loader's file fingerprint (two ``stat`` calls, off the event
  loop) on an interval. Nothing else in the gateway polls ``config.json``.
* **One reload.** When the fingerprint moves -- or an in-process writer calls
  :func:`notify_config_written` -- the watcher performs ONE
  :meth:`KiroCrewConfig.load` off the loop. That load is the same call the rest
  of the tree makes, so the ``publish_*`` snapshots the loader maintains
  (compaction threshold, timezone, alias table, MCP path dirs) ride along for
  free rather than needing a second reader.
* **One dispatch.** The old and new documents are flattened to dotted leaf paths
  and diffed; every subscriber whose prefixes intersect the changed set is
  called, sequentially, on the loop, each guarded so one failing applier cannot
  starve the rest. Subscribers receive a :class:`ConfigChange` carrying both
  configs and the exact changed paths, so an applier can be as narrow as one
  field or as wide as a section.

Design rules this module keeps (see ``docs/system-specs/modules/config.md``):

* No filesystem I/O on the event loop: the fingerprint and the load run in
  ``asyncio.to_thread``. :meth:`snapshot` is a plain attribute read.
* Loads are serialized by the watcher, so the diff is always old-vs-newer and
  an applier never sees an out-of-order pair. Other ``load()`` callers are
  unaffected; the loader's own ticket ordering still governs its snapshots.
* Values are never logged, only changed PATHS -- ``to_dict()`` carries channel
  tokens and the diff sees them.
* A subscriber bound to an object holds it weakly, so a manager that is
  discarded (tests, provider reloads) falls out of the registry on its own.
* Failure is loud, never silent: a load that raises is logged at WARNING and the
  previous snapshot is kept; the next tick retries.

Anything a gateway does in response to a config write -- from the dashboard,
the CLI or ``$EDITOR`` -- belongs behind :func:`subscribe`, not in a request
handler. A handler that mutates ``config.json`` should end with
:func:`notify_config_written` (the loader's writers do this themselves) and
let the watcher apply, so all three writers behave identically.
