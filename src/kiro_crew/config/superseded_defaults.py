"""Detect stored config values that still hold a superseded dataclass default.

Why this module exists
----------------------
``config.json`` is written as a FULL materialization of the schema: every field
lands on disk, including ones the operator never set. The loader then resolves
each field as ``data.get(key, DEFAULT)``, so a stored value always beats the
dataclass default. The consequence is that changing a shipped
default only reaches installs created after the change -- every pre-existing
install keeps whatever value was materialized the last time it wrote config, and
nothing tells anyone.

Why this mostly REPORTS rather than rewrites
--------------------------------------------
An early revision corrected every stored value. That cannot be done safely for a
key that also has a documented escape hatch, and at least one does:
``test_a_real_false_still_turns_it_off`` in the gateway env suite pins that an
explicitly stored ``forward_declared_env: false`` is honoured, and calls it "the
escape hatch for a server that must not share a backend". On disk that escape
hatch and a stale materialized default are the SAME BYTES, so no rewrite can tell
them apart -- correcting one necessarily overrides the other.

So the default stayed REPORT-ONLY, and it still is: an entry rewrites nothing
unless it says ``auto_adopt``.

Why TWO entries adopt themselves anyway
---------------------------------------
Reporting is the right answer only while the two readings of the stored value are
genuinely indistinguishable AND holding the old value is survivable. On the two
agent timeout budgets neither holds: an install carrying
``agent.subagent_timeout_secs: 1800`` reaps every subagent at 30 minutes and the
operator sees timeouts instead of results, having never chosen 1800 at all, and
telling them to run a command they have no reason to know about is not a fix.

The set is deliberately SMALL, and what keeps it small is not a judgment about how
wide the value's range is. That test was tried and is wrong: ``instances.warm_set_cap``
is numeric with a range, and an operator running five crews who types 5 stores
exactly the old default -- an ordinary config, not a coincidence. The test that
holds is whether the repository ALREADY PINS the stored value as a supported
configuration. Three rows do, and all three stay report-only:
``test_a_persisted_ceiling_value_is_left_alone`` (``session.autocompact_pct``),
``test_explicit_desktop_default_is_preserved_for_managed_service``
(``dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs``), and ``test_put_persists_streaming``
(``stt.streaming``). A row whose old value some other suite guarantees is not stale
noise by definition, whatever its type.

Two things make the rewrite safe on the rows that remain, without the per-key
provenance the config layer still lacks:

* ``auto_adopt`` is per ENTRY, so the judgment is made once, by name, in the
  registry -- not inferred by a rule that would eventually sweep up a key like
  ``forward_declared_env``;
* adoption is ONE-SHOT, recorded in the sidecar's ``adopted`` map. A key is
  adopted at most once per install, so a value the operator sets back afterwards is
  their choice and is never touched again. Without that record the mechanism would
  re-remove a restored value on every load, which is the one behaviour worse than
  saying nothing.

``--keep`` still wins: an acknowledged value is not drift, so affirming a key
before it is adopted keeps it, and the ack is what an operator who DID choose 1800
uses to say so.

Adoption is an un-materialization, not a write of the new value: the stored key is
removed, so the field resolves through ``data.get(key, DEFAULT)`` to whatever the
running build ships. That lasts only until the next FULL rewrite of ``config.json``
-- any settings save re-materializes the current number -- so a later default move
on the same key still needs its own registry row rather than riding along.

Why the report is acknowledgeable
---------------------------------
Value equality alone cannot falsify a report, so an operator who deliberately
chose a value that happens to equal a superseded default would be told about it
on every load, forever, with no way to answer. Worse, the registry is
append-only: each new entry adds another permanent line, and a section that is
mostly unanswerable noise is a section operators learn to skip -- which costs
exactly the genuine drift the mechanism exists to surface.

So the report is falsifiable. :func:`acked_superseded` reads an
acknowledgment file recording ``<dotted key> -> the value that was acked``, and a
key whose STORED value still equals its acked value is not reported. The value is
recorded rather than a bare key name so the acknowledgment covers the choice, not
the key: change the value later and the report returns.

The acknowledgment lives in its own file, NOT in ``config.json``, because a full
``to_dict()`` rewrite carries only schema fields -- the same materialization
behaviour that created this whole problem would silently drop an ack stored
anywhere in the config document. Losing the file is harmless by construction: it
changes no runtime behaviour, only whether one line is printed.

Scope discipline
-----------------
Nothing here writes to CONFIGURATION. Detection is pure; :func:`drop_drifted_keys`
mutates a dict handed to it by a caller that already owns the config lock;
:func:`record_acks` opens ``config.json`` only to READ it, under that same lock,
because acknowledging a value it did not just read would record a stale one. The
one file this module writes is the acknowledgment file, which holds no settings.

Rendering splits by who asked. ``doctor``'s section lives HERE, reading
``config.json`` directly, so the config package stays the one place that knows what
the stored document means. ``kirocrew config defaults`` lives in ``cli_config``,
because deciding what to DO about drift -- adopt, affirm, or just look -- is the
CLI's job, and it calls into the helpers above rather than reimplementing them.
