"""Windows Task Scheduler backend for pods — the win32 sibling of
:mod:`kiro_crew.pod.unit` (systemd) and :mod:`kiro_crew.pod.launchd`.

The pod runtime's platform-neutral core (name validation, port derivation,
checkout resolution and pinning, env scrubbing, token minting, ``boot``, and the
``cleanup_home`` teardown safety check) is reused unchanged. Only the
service-manager mechanics differ.

**Why Task Scheduler and not a Windows service.** A pod is a per-user,
no-elevation, disposable gateway supervised by the OS. ``sc.exe create`` needs
``SeCreateServiceNamePrivilege`` — an administrator right — and installs a
machine-wide LocalSystem service, so it is the wrong fit twice over: a developer
would have to elevate to test a worktree, and the pod would stop running as the
user whose ``~/.kiro`` it is isolating from. ``schtasks.exe`` creates a task in
the calling user's own namespace with no elevation, which is exactly the systemd
``--user`` / launchd ``gui/<uid>`` shape.

Five things differ from the other two backends, and each one is load-bearing:

**1. No task-level environment variables.** A systemd unit carries
``Environment=`` lines and a launchd plist carries ``EnvironmentVariables``. A
scheduled task carries neither: its action is one command line and it runs with
the user's *profile* environment, so any ``KIROCREW_POD_*`` override the CLI
resolved would be lost. The pod's action is therefore a generated ``.cmd``
wrapper (:func:`render_task_script`) that sets the plane from
:func:`kiro_crew.pod.config.environment_vars` — the same selection both other
backends serialise — and then re-enters ``kirocrew pod _run <name>``. The wrapper
is data, not logic: boot stays in :func:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime.boot`, so nothing
shell-shaped ships in the package.

**2. No ``KeepAlive`` / ``Restart=on-failure``.** Task Scheduler can retry a
*failed start*, not a process that exited non-zero, so a crashed pod stays down.
That removes the restart-loop hazard the launchd backend has to work around with
its exit-0 translation, and it means the crash
signal ``pod up`` waits on has to be derived rather than read: the wrapper
records the boot's exit code beside the task and :func:`unit_state` reports
``failed`` when that code is non-zero and the supervised process is gone.

**3. No PID from the service manager.** ``systemctl show -p MainPID`` and
``launchctl print`` both name the running process; ``schtasks /Query`` names
none, at any verbosity. Worse, Windows has no ``exec``: CPython's ``os.execve``
there *spawns and exits*, so the systemd invariant "the gateway REPLACES the
unit's main process, therefore ``MainPID`` is the process that bound the port"
cannot hold. So :func:`supervise_gateway` spawns the gateway as a child of the
wrapper, records its pid plus its process-creation identity beside the task, and
waits on it — which restores the invariant with the wrapper as the supervisor.
:func:`main_pid` reads that record. It stays an *independent* fact from the
gateway PID sidecar ``port_owner`` compares it against: different file,
different directory, different writer.

**4. ``schtasks`` output is LOCALIZED, so this backend never parses it.** Both
the CSV column headers and the ``Status`` values of ``schtasks /Query /FO CSV
/V`` are translated on a non-English Windows, so a reader keyed on ``"Status" ==
"Running"`` silently reports every pod down on a German host — the fail-OPEN
direction, which would let teardown delete a live pod's HOME. Liveness and the
last result are therefore read from the two files the supervised process itself
writes, which are locale-independent, cheaper (no subprocess), and more precise
(they name the gateway, which is what ``main_pid`` owes its caller). ``schtasks``
is used only for verbs whose *exit code* is the answer: ``/Create``, ``/Run``,
``/End``, ``/Delete``, ``/Query`` as an existence probe.

**5. No cgroups, so the ceiling is a Job object instead — and it IS enforced.**
The systemd unit's ``MemoryMax=4G`` and ``CPUQuota=200%`` are kernel-enforced
cgroup limits with no scheduled-task equivalent, so :func:`supervise_gateway`
attaches a Windows Job object to the gateway instead, through
:func:`kiro_crew.sandbox.apply_windows_resource_ceiling` — the same seam and the
same ``resource_limits`` config the agent-subprocess path uses, so one operator
setting governs both platforms. The child is created ``CREATE_SUSPENDED`` and
resumed only after the job is attached, which is what makes it airtight rather
than merely small: job membership covers a member's future descendants but not
ones it already spawned. Two honest gaps remain. The process row is a LOOSER
bound than the cgroup row (``ActiveProcessLimit`` counts processes where
``TasksMax`` counts threads), and there is no CPU row at all, because a Job
object's CPU rate control is a different mechanism from ``CPUQuota`` and is not
wired here. So do not read this as parity with the systemd unit; read it as a
real fork-bomb and memory ceiling where there was none. macOS still has neither.

Every other isolation property is unchanged: own ``KIROCREW_HOME``, own derived
port, no tunnel, ``--no-crons``, and the refusal to bind the live port.

    **``/End`` is asynchronous and only reaches the task's own process.** It
    returns before the wrapper has exited, and Task Scheduler's termination is
    not a contractual kill of the whole tree, so the gateway can outlive it. The
    caller reaps the pod's isolated HOME immediately afterwards, so returning
    early means deleting state from under a live writer — the removal then fails
    quietly while the CLI reports zero residue. So poll the SUPERVISED PID, not
    the task's status: that is the process whose death makes the HOME safe to
    delete, and it is the reading that is not localized.

    **A survivor is escalated, not waited out forever.** Once the window
    expires the gateway is killed through
    :func:`kiro_crew.platform_compat.kill_process_tree_pinned`, which will not
    fire unless the creation-time token still matches — so a recycled pid cannot
    be signalled.

    **The unload result must be authoritative.** If the gateway is STILL alive,
    if any child it had when the stop began is still alive (the pid record says
    nothing about children, so they are snapshotted first and ended, pinned,
    after the gateway), or the task could not be deleted, this returns a failure
    and keeps the wrapper script: the caller must not tear down state that may
    belong to a live pod. A ``/End`` or ``/Delete`` against a task that is not there is a
    no-op, not a failure, which is why both are judged by re-probing existence
    rather than by their own exit code.

    logs rather than in ``last_result``. That is no worse than before adoption
    existed (the record was cleared and the task exited 0 either way) and it is
    strictly better on the thing that mattered: the pod stays visible to every
    verb instead of becoming one ``pod down`` would reclaim underneath.

    **The win32 substitute for ``os.execve``**, which the POSIX path ends with.
    Windows has no ``exec``: CPython's ``os.execve`` spawns a new process and
    terminates the caller, so using it here would (a) change the pid, breaking
    ``main_pid``'s contract that it names the process which bound the port, and
    (b) let the task's own process exit while the gateway kept running,
    orphaned, with Task Scheduler reporting the task finished. Supervising
    instead keeps the wrapper alive as the parent, which is what makes ``/End``
    a real stop and the pid record a real identity.

    ``CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`` is the analogue of the POSIX
    ``start_new_session``: a Ctrl+C in whatever console the task ran under must
    not reach the pod. Standard handles are deliberately INHERITED so the
    gateway's output lands in the log files the wrapper redirected — that is the
    journal on this platform.

    **The resource ceiling is applied here, and this is the only place it can
    be.** systemd caps a pod with ``MemoryMax``/``CPUQuota`` on the unit; a
    scheduled task has no such field, so the Windows equivalent is a Job object,
    which cannot be expressed as an argv prefix and has to be attached to a live
    pid. The ordering below is what makes it airtight rather than merely small:
    the child is created ``CREATE_SUSPENDED`` (it has executed no instructions,
    so it provably has no descendants that could already have escaped the job),
    the ceiling is attached, and only then is it resumed. That is the sequence
    ``platform-compat.md`` names for race-free Job object assignment, and
    :func:`kiro_crew.sandbox.apply_windows_resource_ceiling` reads the same
    ``resource_limits`` config the cgroup path reads, so one operator setting
    governs both platforms.

    A ceiling that could not be installed does NOT fail the boot: that matches
    how an unavailable cgroup scope is handled, and ``apply_job_limits`` has
    already logged it as a SECURITY warning. A failed RESUME is the opposite --
    the child is alive but frozen, so it is terminated rather than left to
    masquerade as a running gateway, which is the policy
    ``acp.client.finish_suspended_spawn`` implements for the same handshake.

    A pid record that cannot be WRITTEN is fatal for the same reason, one step
    later. That record is this platform's only liveness answer, so a gateway
    running without one is a pod every reader calls stopped, and the first
    ``pod down`` deletes its task and its isolated HOME while it serves. The
    child is terminated with a pinned tree kill, no record is left behind, and
    the exit names the path that could not be written.
